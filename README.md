<p id="description">A decentralized platform allowing users to securely upload images stored using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for robust data storage. Utilizing Solidity a smart contract ledger is established and deployed on the Polygon Mumbai testnet to store crucial IPFS image hash details. Through a React-based dashboard, users gain seamless access to all uploaded images integrating wallet-based sign-in for enhanced security. Additionally users can effortlessly share images with others by utilizing their account addresses fostering a user-friendly and secure image-sharing experience.</p>
